# Fun Friday With Code

- For today's class you will fork this repo and not clone it
- If you have any code to push, make a PR, [here](https://gist.github.com/kingluddite/46ec6602a0912a63ea0aa652fa334153) are the instructions on how to fork code and make PRs

## Breakout Rooms

Today for Office hours we have multiple breakout rooms. After reading this README, pick the topic you are interested in and jump into that room.

- One room for each team in Project 1 if you want to take class time today to refactor your project code
- Three rooms if you want to work on catch up on past challenges

## Five Learning New Stuff Rooms

Embark on a riveting journey through the uncharted territories of frontend development! In this exciting class, channel your inner Lewis and Clark as you become intrepid explorers seeking out new technologies in the vast wilderness of the web. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to delve into the unexplored realms of documentation, much like navigating the undiscovered landscapes of the American West. Be the pioneers of your generation, parsing through the dense thickets of API references and code snippets to uncover the treasures of cutting-edge frontend technologies. Just as Lewis and Clark forged their path with curiosity and courage, navigate the wilderness of web development, deciphering the languages of JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and tools. Embrace the spirit of exploration, and, like those legendary explorers, chart your own course as you venture into the exciting unknown of the ever-evolving world of frontend development. May your discoveries be as grand as the landscapes that unfolded before those who dared to venture into the unexplored!

## Algos

Practicing algorithms is a crucial and effective preparation strategy for job interviews in the field of software development. Algorithmic problem-solving not only hones your ability to tackle complex programming challenges but also sharpens your logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Job interviews often include algorithmic questions to assess a candidate's capacity to devise efficient and elegant solutions within a given time frame. Regular practice exposes you to a variety of problem-solving patterns, helping you become more adept at recognizing and applying common algorithms and data structures. Engaging in algorithm practice not only builds confidence but also familiarizes you with the problem-solving mindset required in real-world development scenarios. Ultimately, honing your algorithmic skills enhances your overall programming proficiency and equips you to approach technical interviews with competence and composure.

## (advanced) Svelte

Svelte.js is a modern JavaScript framework that takes a unique approach to front-end development. Unlike traditional frameworks that shift much of the work to the browser at runtime, Svelte shifts the bulk of the work to build time. It is a compiler-based framework that converts components written in its concise and expressive syntax into highly optimized JavaScript during the build process. This results in smaller and faster runtime code, as Svelte itself is not shipped to the browser. With a focus on simplicity and performance, Svelte offers a refreshing alternative for building efficient and reactive user interfaces, making it particularly attractive for developers aiming to create fast, lightweight web applications.
